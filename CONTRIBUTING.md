# Contributing to Flyt

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Flyt! We welcome contributions from the open-source community and appreciate your help in making Flyt better. We recommend getting familiar with our [README](https://github.com/equinor/flyt/blob/main/README.md) before getting started.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please report it [here](https://github.com/equinor/flyt/issues/new/choose). When reporting issues, please select and fill in one of our issue templates with as much details as possible.

## Contributing Code

We welcome contributions of code, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. To contribute code to Flyt, please follow these steps:

- Clone the Flyt repository and create a new branch from main.

- Make your changes and ensure that they follow the coding standards for the project.

- All commits should have a [semantic commit message](https://github.com/equinor/flyt?tab=readme-ov-file#semantic-commit-messages)

- Create a pull request to the Flyt repository. The pull request title should follow the same semantics as commit messages.

- Your changes will be reviewed by the maintainers of the project. If there are any issues with your changes, they will provide feedback and guidance on how to address them.

- Once your changes have been approved, they will be merged into the main branch of the Flyt repository, and eventually released.

_Currently, only Equinor-registered accounts are able to login and make API calls, which may be a barrier for some contributors. A possible workaround is to remove the Msal authentication and write mock data, although we acknowledge that this requires significant effort. We're working to improve accessibility for all contributors._

## Code of Conduct

All contributors to Flyt are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.equinor.com/about-us/ethics-and-compliance).

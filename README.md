# Developing

To get up and running:
`yarn && yarn use-dev`

## Running different environments locally

| Env. |     command     |
| ---- | :-------------: |
| Dev  | `yarn use-dev`  |
| Test | `yarn use-test` |
| QA   |  `yarn use-qa`  |
| PROD | `yarn use-prod` |

### What it does

For example: running `yarn use-dev` replaces the root `.env` file with `environment-variables/DEV.env`, then it
runs `yarn dev`.

## Branching and deploying stuff

We use a simple branching structure. Instead of having a `master` and `develop` branch we just use one `main`-branch.

The `main`-branch contains the latest changes.

We use a "sliding tag" for each environment... Tag something DEV, TEST, QA or PROD, and it should trigger a new build
and release. This gets rid of the "empty Pull requests" for releases, which is something we would have if we do a PR
into `Master` from `Develop`. Also, this gives us more flexibility to release from another branch if we need to do that
for some reason.

I've added a simple script to automate this:
For example; Run `yarn release-dev` to tag DEV and push tags to GitHub.

> **NOTE:** This script need to be updated to accomadate for multiple people updating the tags. Until then, try to update the tag and push it manually. [Read more about git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).

| Environment | Release script          | Deploy status                                                                                                                  | URL                                     | Who should test what?       | Comments                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| PROD        | Run `yarn release-prod` | ![PROD environment build status in Radix](https://api.radix.equinor.com/api/v1/applications/vsm/environments/prod/buildstatus) | https://web-vsm-prod.radix.equinor.com/ | End-users                   | We wait with deploying to prod until everyone is happy                           |

> **Note:** When running `yarn release-<environment>` we are starting a new build in Radix. If we already have a working build and want to release it to another environment, we may "promote" it to a different environment via the [Radix-console](https://console.radix.equinor.com/applications/vsm).

## Docker

```bash
# Building image
docker build -t equinor-flyt .

# Running image
## Dev
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file ./environment-variables/DEV.env equinor-flyt
## Test
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file ./environment-variables/TEST.env equinor-flyt
## QA
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file ./environment-variables/QA.env equinor-flyt
## Prod
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file ./environment-variables/PROD.env equinor-flyt
```

## Runtime environment variables

When using NEXT.JS, the environment variables need to be set when building the image and not at runtime.

> Generally you'll want to use build-time environment variables to provide your configuration. The reason for this is that runtime configuration adds rendering / initialization overhead and is incompatible with Automatic Static Optimization.

> [Read more ...](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/runtime-configuration)

To work-around this we are disabling "automatic static optimization" at our root level. Adding this to `_app.tsx`:

```javascript
MyApp.getInitialProps = async (appContext: AppContext) => {
  const appProps = await App.getInitialProps(appContext);

  return { ...appProps };
};
```

Which disables "automatic static optimization" for all our
pages. [Read more ...](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/master/errors/opt-out-auto-static-optimization.md)

# Pixi js Canvas

## Making space for stuff

Put every Main activity and all it's children inside a container. That container width can be used to figure out
the distance to the next Main Activity etc...

# Defining a process

A vsm/flyt/process consists of a set of entities.

An entity can be of the following types:

- MainActivity
- SubActivity
- Choice
- Waiting

Structure of an entity

```json5
{
  id: "",
  type: "MainActivity",
  text: "",
  roles: [],
  duration: 0,
  problems: [],
  ideas: [],
  solutions: [],
  parentId: "",
}
```

# Semantic Commit Messages

> Copied from https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

`<scope>` is optional

## Example

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

More Examples:

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
